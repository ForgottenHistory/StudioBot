Host: Next up on K-NULL, we got a special guest. Say hi, Bob.

Bob: Hi Bob. I mean, hi listeners.

Host: Bob here claims he invented a sandwich that eats itself.

Bob: Saves you the calories, man. You just hear a little burp and it's gone.

Host: Right. Remind me, what's the return policy?

Bob: If your sandwich vanishes before you unwrap it, you get a free fork. No questions asked.

Host: Bold offer, Bob. Folks, call in now while the sandwiches still exist.
